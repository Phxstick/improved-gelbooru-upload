- **Wiki integration**: when entering tags, press F2 to view the wiki page for the currently selected tag suggestion, and press Escape to close the wiki again. Alternatively, you can right-click a tag and select "Open wiki page".
- **Danbooru support** (must be enabled in the settings first): posts can now be uploaded on Danbooru's upload page using the same interface as on Gelbooru.
    - Danbooru supports post relationships which can be established from here by selecting multiple tabs (using ctrl/shift keys), right-clicking the tab with the parent image and clicking "Upload as parent/children".
    - Data can be moved back and forth between Danbooru's and Gelbooru's upload pages by right-clicking a tab (or one of multiple selected tabs) and clicking "Upload to Danbooru/Gelbooru".
- IQDB search now also works for very large images (will be shrunk automatically).
- Tags can now be removed more conveniently by clicking them while pressing the Alt key.

Version 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Tabs**: useful for preparing to post multiple images at the same time.
- **Easier Pixiv upload**: Pixiv artwork can be uploaded more easily with the [Pixiv to Gelbooru upload helper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pixiv-to-gelbooru-upload/hbghinibnihlfahabmgdanonolmihbko).
- **Automatic artist search for Pixiv images**: click the artist search field to automatically find the corresponding artist tag if the image is from Pixiv (so there's no need to manually copy&paste an artist page link).
